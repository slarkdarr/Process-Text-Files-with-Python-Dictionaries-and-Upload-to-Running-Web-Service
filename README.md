# Process-Text-Files-with-Python-Dictionaries-and-Upload-to-Running-Web-Service
Module 2 Project of Automating Real-World Tasks with Python

# Introduction
I’m working at a company that sells second-hand cars. My company constantly collects feedback in the form of customer reviews. My manager asks me to take those reviews (saved as .txt files) and display them on my company’s website. To do this, I’ll need to write a script to convert those .txt files and process them into Python dictionaries, then upload the data onto my company’s website (currently using Django).

# What I’ll do
+ Use the Python OS module to process a directory of text files 

+ Manage information stored in Python dictionaries

+ Use the Python requests module to upload content to a running Web service

+ Understand basic operations for Python requests like GET and POST methods
